  abstract = {The tourism industry has grown in leaps and bounds in South Africa, since the first democratic elections in 1994. Tourism has not just been developmental, but has gained prominence as the new gold. The mining sector has lost its lustre as the major contributor to the economy of the country. Mining has declined as a core contributor to the gross domestic product, ravaging the economy of many towns and cities in South Africa. The growth trap that South Africa finds itself in, has meant that there must be a sector that can alleviate the structural challenges and promote entrepreneurship. Tourism has sustained growth and this has meant it has been accepted as the panacea for all of the economic challenges of the country. Additionally, tourism has been associated with distributive responsibilities in line with the principles of empowerment, especially for the previously disadvantages groups. The tourism industry has had limited local benefit even in the face of more inbound tourism arrivals because of the skewed ownership patterns that reflect the colonial legacy of the tourism industry of South Africa. Disruptive technology provided by Airbnb has ensured that more cost effective accommodation is provided for destinations in South Africa, which now use underutilized hosting space for loading as Airbnb hosts. This has driven the growth of the tourism industry especially around the Western Cape Province, including Cape Town. This literature review on Airbnb fills a gap in academic scrutiny on disruptive entrepreneurship provided by Airbnb in the tourism economy of South Africa. Disruptive entrepreneurship will have a profound impact on the South African economy, which is struggling with raising entrepreneurship levels, for a country with an abnormally high rate of unemployment leading to poverty.},

  abstract = {This paper studies how the sharing economy fundamentally changes the way the industry accommodates demand fluctuations and how incumbent firms should strategically respond in the context of Airbnb and hotels.           ,              The entry of flexible-capacity sharing economy platforms (e.g., Airbnb and Uber) has potentially changed the competitive landscape in traditional industries with fixed-capacity incumbents and volatile demand. Leveraging panel data on hotels and Airbnb, we study how the sharing economy fundamentally changes the way the industry accommodates demand fluctuations and how incumbent firms should strategically respond. The demand estimates suggest that Airbnb's flexible supply helps recover the lost underlying demand due to hotel seasonal pricing (i.e., higher prices during high-demand seasons) and even stimulates more demand in some cities. The counterfactual results suggest that some hotel types in some cities may benefit from conducting less seasonal pricing and even considering counter-seasonal pricing. Market conditions (e.g., seasonality patterns, hotel prices and quality, consumer composition, and Airbnb supply elasticity) play a crucial role in determining the impact of Airbnb on hotel sales and hotels' strategic response. Finally, recent Airbnb and policy changes (e.g., higher Airbnb hosting costs due to hotel taxes or lower Airbnb hosting costs due to third-party services and the ``professionalism'' of hosts) affect the competitive dynamics. The profits of high-end hotels are the most sensitive to the changes in Airbnb hosting costs. Airbnb's recent attempt to behave more like hotels can increase hotels' vulnerability to lower Airbnb hosting costs.

  abstract = {Airbnb and other short-term rental services are a topic of increasing concern for urban researchers, policymakers, and activists, because of the fear that short-term rentals are facilitating gentrification. This article presents a framework for analyzing the relationship between short-term rentals and gentrification, an exploratory case study of New York City, and an agenda for future research. We argue that Airbnb has introduced a new potential revenue flow into housing markets which is systematic but geographically uneven, creating a new form of rent gap in culturally desirable and internationally recognizable neighborhoods. This rent gap can emerge quickly\textemdash in advance of any declining property income\textemdash and requires minimal new capital to be exploited by a range of different housing actors, from developers to landlords, tenants, and homeowners. Performing spatial analysis on three years of Airbnb activity in New York City, we measure new capital flows into the short-term rental market, identify neighborhoods whose housing markets have already been significantly impacted by short term, identify neighborhoods which are increasingly under threat of Airbnb-induced gentrification, and estimate the amount of rental housing lost to Airbnb. Finally, we conclude by offering a research agenda on gentrification and the sharing economy.},

The authors explore the economic impact of the sharing economy on incumbent firms by studying the case of Airbnb, a prominent platform for short-term accommodations. They analyze Airbnb's entry into the state of Texas and quantify its impact on the Texas hotel industry over the subsequent decade. In Austin, where Airbnb supply is highest, the causal impact on hotel revenue is in the 8\%\textendash 10\% range; moreover, the impact is nonuniform, with lower-priced hotels and hotels that do not cater to business travelers being the most affected. The impact manifests itself primarily through less aggressive hotel room pricing, benefiting all consumers, not just participants in the sharing economy. The price response is especially pronounced during periods of peak demand, such as during the South by Southwest festival, and is due to a differentiating feature of peer-to-peer platforms\textemdash enabling instantaneous supply to scale to meet demand.},
